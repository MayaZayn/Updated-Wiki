To-Do:
    style:
        add footer
        make text doesn't look like buttons
        make the select file cursor change
        make the files at the side panel have the same format (either underline all links or don't)
        make the landing page different and no one can edit it
        make returns almost the same (same style)
    functionality:
        add history
        add search
        view image uploaded via markdown
        fix db shared issue

    error handling
    check for more redundancy
    make sure everything has one resposibility
    add features if I want
    antiforgery (Are they used whenever needed?)
